# Selenium Test Automation Project

This project contains automated tests for the login functionality of the **SauceDemo** website using Selenium WebDriver. The tests are parameterized, parallelized, and logged using NLog.

## Task Description

The goal of the project is to automate the login functionality and validate the expected behavior for different test cases:

- **UC-1**: Test login form with empty credentials.
- **UC-2**: Test login form with credentials by passing Username only.
- **UC-3**: Test login form with valid Username and Password.

The tests are performed using different browsers (Chrome and Edge) and use the following technologies:

- **Test Automation Tool**: Selenium WebDriver
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Edge
- **Locators**: XPath
- **Test Runner**: MSTest
- **Patterns**: Abstract Factory
- **Assertions**: Fluent Assertions
- **Logging**: NLog
- **Parallel Execution**: Configured in `.runsettings` file

## Prerequisites

To run the tests, ensure that the following tools are installed:

1. **Visual Studio** (2019 or later)
2. **.NET Framework 4.5 or later**
3. **Selenium WebDriver** and **FluentAssertions** packages from NuGet
4. **MSTest** test framework (via NuGet)
5. **NLog** for logging
